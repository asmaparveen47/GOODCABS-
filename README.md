# GOODCABS-
**HI**

I recently analyzed the GoodCabs dataset to assess the company’s performance across key metrics: trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. Using SQL for data extraction, Power BI for visualizations, and Canva for reporting, I identified actionable insights to optimize operations and improve service quality

**Key metrics **

a.Trip Volume: Identifying trends in ride frequency, peak times, and demand patterns.
